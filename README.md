# 4-Bit Full Adder Circuit â€“ Logic Circuits I Project

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Design a 4-bit full adder circuit to sum two unsigned 4-bit numbers and display the result on a 7-segment display.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Solution Overview

We implemented a 4-bit full adder to sum two binary numbers. The output was decoded using **Excess-3 BCD encoding**:

- Incremented the three least significant bits by 1.
- Decoded each 4-bit segment using **BCD code**.
- This was done twice for each 2-bit pair of the sum.

### Data Flow:
1. Output of the full adder was passed through:
   - Comparator `[7485]`
   - Multiplexer `[74157]`
   - Full Adder `[7483]`
2. Carry routed through a BCD decoder `[7447]` to show the **tens** digit.
3. The sum routed through another decoder to display the **units** digit.

## ðŸ§® Karnaugh Maps & Minimization

### Sum

- Minterms: `m(1, 2, 4, 7)`
- Simplified:
  Sum = AB'C' + A'B'C + ABC + A'BC' = C(AB + A'B') + C'(A'B + AB') = C âŠ• (A âŠ• B)


### Carry

- Minterms: `m(3, 5, 6, 7)`
- Simplified:
  Cout = AB + AC + BC
